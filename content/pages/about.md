Title: About


I'm Claudinei Matos, a Computer Scientist from Brazil. I live in Rio de Janeiro with my wife, my son and our pets.
I love to learn new technologies and I do have a big interest on subjects like Open Source, Operation Systems, Servers and Automation.
I do have great experience on managing infraestructures and web development.

On my free time I like to stay with my family, watching TV, playing video games with my son and reading a good book or comic book.

Feel free to reach me on one of my Social Network profiles!
